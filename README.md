## About

Gravity Snake reimagines the classic Snake game by introducing gravity physics and strategic, turn-based movement.

Unlike traditional Snake games that rely on reflexes, Gravity Snake is a puzzle game where you must think several moves ahead. The snake only moves when you act, and after each move, gravity pulls it downward until it hits an obstacle or the floor.

## How to Play

- **🎮 Controls:** Use arrow keys or WASD to move
- **🎯 Goal:** Collect all food, then reach the exit
- **⚠️ Rules:**
  - Avoid hitting walls, obstacles, or yourself
  - You cannot reverse direction (no 180° turns)
  - Gravity pulls you down after each move
- **🔄 Restart:** Press `R` to restart the current level
- **🏠 Menu:** Press `Q` to return to level 1

## Features
