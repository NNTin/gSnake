# Ralph Progress Log
# Feature: CI Test Workflows Across gSnake Repos
# Branch: ralph/ci-tests-and-workflows

## Codebase Patterns
- gSnake is a monorepo with submodules: gsnake-core (Rust), gsnake-web (TypeScript), gsnake-levels (Rust), gsnake-editor (TypeScript), gsnake-specs (Markdown)
- gsnake-core builds to WASM for web consumption
- CI workflows should use nektos/act compatible actions
- Root repo has detection scripts in scripts/ directory
- Submodules require committing changes inside the submodule directory first, then updating root repo
- Unit tests in Rust use #[cfg(test)] blocks inline in source files
- Integration tests in Rust go in tests/ directory and access public modules via lib.rs exports
- GitHub Actions workflows for submodules should checkout both the submodule and root repo, then create symlinks
- Test fixtures should exist in the repo (levels/, playbacks/, fixtures/) for integration tests

## 2026-01-29 - US-001
- Verified that repo-architecture.md already contains all required documentation
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Dependency Resolution Strategy section exists (lines 72-148)
  - ✅ Git URL format documented for Rust and JavaScript
  - ✅ Branch strategy documented (all deps target main branch)
  - ✅ Auto-detection mechanism explained with implementation details
  - ✅ Versioning strategy documented (root repo semver vs submodule main branch tracking)
  - ✅ Examples included for both Rust (Cargo.toml) and JavaScript (package.json)
  - ✅ Comprehensive troubleshooting section (lines 149-257)
  - ✅ Architecture diagram updated with dual-mode visualization
- Files reviewed: gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-001 was already completed in previous work - the documentation is comprehensive
  - Always verify file state before assuming work needs to be done
  - The repo-architecture.md file is the central source of truth for dependency strategy
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-002
- Verified that gsnake-core/.github/workflows/ci.yml already exists with complete CI workflow
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ CI workflow with three jobs: build, test, and wasm (wasm is more critical than doc for this project)
  - ✅ Triggers on push to main, pull requests, and workflow_dispatch
  - ✅ Compatible with nektos/act (uses standard actions, no GitHub-specific features)
  - ✅ WASM build target validated with wasm32-unknown-unknown in dedicated job
  - ✅ Uses standard actions: actions/checkout@v4, dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable, actions/cache@v4
- Files reviewed: gsnake-core/.github/workflows/ci.yml
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-002 was already completed in previous work
  - The CI workflow includes proper caching for cargo registry, index, and build artifacts
  - WASM validation is in a separate job with wasm-pack installation
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-003
- Verified that gsnake-core/README.md already contains comprehensive standalone build documentation
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Standalone Build section with clear instructions (lines 11-39)
  - ✅ Commands included: cargo build, cargo test, cargo doc, plus cargo run (lines 23-34)
  - ✅ WASM build process documented with wasm-pack commands (lines 36-50)
  - ✅ Known Issues section for troubleshooting common build issues (lines 52-55)
  - ✅ Additional CI/CD section with nektos/act testing instructions and limitations
- Files reviewed: gsnake-core/README.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-003 was already completed in previous work
  - The README is well-structured with prerequisites, build commands, WASM output info, troubleshooting, and CI/CD guidance
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-004
- Verified that gsnake-levels/Cargo.toml already uses git dependency for gsnake-core
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Cargo.toml uses git dependency instead of local path (lines 16-19)
  - ✅ Git dependency format matches exactly: git = "https://github.com/nntin/gsnake", branch = "main", package = "gsnake-core"
  - ✅ No --manifest-path references found in gsnake-levels codebase
- Files reviewed: gsnake-levels/Cargo.toml
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-004 was already completed in previous work
  - The Cargo.toml includes helpful comments explaining the dual-mode strategy
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-005
- Verified that gsnake-levels has complete auto-detection mechanism for local overrides
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Detection script in build.rs checks for ../.git and ../gsnake-core/Cargo.toml (lines 11-14)
  - ✅ Local path override implemented via .cargo/config.toml with [patch] section (lines 38-39 in build.rs)
  - ✅ cargo build succeeds in root repo context (tested successfully)
  - ✅ cargo test succeeds in root repo context (tested successfully)
  - ✅ Standalone mode supported via git dependency (US-004) and CI workflow (US-002)
- Files reviewed: gsnake-levels/build.rs, gsnake-levels/.cargo/config.toml
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-005 was already completed in previous work
  - The build.rs script is smart: it auto-generates .cargo/config.toml with [patch] section when root repo detected
  - The script also removes the patch section when switching to standalone mode
  - Detection uses Cargo.toml existence instead of .git (more reliable for directory detection)
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-006
- Verified that gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/ci.yml already exists with complete CI workflow
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ CI workflow with build and test jobs for standalone validation
  - ✅ Compatible with nektos/act (uses standard actions)
  - ✅ Triggers on push to main, pull requests, and workflow_dispatch
  - ✅ Validates both cargo build and cargo test in separate jobs
- Files reviewed: gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/ci.yml
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-006 was already completed in previous work
  - Similar structure to gsnake-core CI workflow with proper caching
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-007
- Verified that gsnake-levels/README.md already contains comprehensive standalone build documentation
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Local Override Detection section documents the override mechanism (lines 16-41)
  - ✅ Build commands and usage examples included (lines 79-120)
  - ✅ Auto-detection behavior explained with detection logic and transparent mode switching
  - ✅ CI/CD section with nektos/act instructions serves as troubleshooting (lines 43-77)
- Files reviewed: gsnake-levels/README.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-007 was already completed in previous work
  - README provides excellent explanation of dual-mode dependency resolution
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-008
- Updated detect-local-deps.js to implement dual-mode dependency resolution
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Detection script now switches package.json dependency based on context
  - ✅ Git dependency format: git+https://github.com/nntin/gsnake.git#main:gsnake-core/engine/bindings/wasm/pkg
  - ✅ Standalone mode will automatically use git dependency to fetch prebuilt WASM
  - ✅ Root repo mode uses file: path for local development
- Files changed: gsnake-web/scripts/detect-local-deps.js
- Quality checks passed: npm run check succeeded
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - npm DOES support git dependencies for subdirectories with the syntax: git+https://repo.git#branch:path
  - The preinstall script automatically updates package.json based on detected context
  - Prebuilt WASM artifacts in the pkg/ directory enable standalone builds without local Rust compilation
  - gsnake-web is a git submodule, so changes must be committed within the submodule first, then root repo updated
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-009
- Verified that gsnake-web/scripts/detect-local-deps.js already exists with complete auto-detection logic
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Detection script exists and checks for ../.git and ../gsnake-core/Cargo.toml (lines 22-26)
  - ✅ Auto-detection implemented: switches to file:../gsnake-core/engine/bindings/wasm/pkg in root repo mode (lines 35-56)
  - ✅ Integrated into build process via preinstall hook in package.json (line 7)
- Script tested successfully: correctly detects root repo context and confirms local dependency is configured
- Files reviewed: gsnake-web/scripts/detect-local-deps.js, gsnake-web/package.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-009 was completed as part of US-008 work - the detection script is fully functional
  - The preinstall hook runs before npm install, ensuring the correct dependency is always configured
  - Script provides helpful logging to show which mode is detected and what actions are taken
  - In root repo mode, script validates that WASM pkg exists and exits with error if missing
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-010
- Created scripts/build-wasm.js to conditionally handle WASM builds
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Standalone mode: script detects and skips WASM build, expects prebuilt from git dependency
  - ✅ Root repo mode: script runs python3 ../../scripts/build_wasm.py before build
  - ✅ npm run build succeeds in root repo (tested with prebuild hook running WASM build + tests)
  - ✅ npm run check succeeds (0 errors, 0 warnings)
  - ✅ npm test succeeds (41 tests passed)
  - ✅ Updated package.json: prebuild now runs "node scripts/build-wasm.js && npm test"
- Files changed: gsnake-web/scripts/build-wasm.js (new), gsnake-web/package.json
- Quality checks passed: npm run check, npm test, npm run build all succeed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The prebuild script runs automatically before build, ensuring WASM is always up-to-date
  - Conditional build logic prevents errors in standalone mode where build scripts don't exist
  - Using Node.js scripts instead of shell scripts improves cross-platform compatibility
  - spawnSync with stdio: 'inherit' passes through all output from child processes
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-011
- Verified that contract test fixtures are already committed to gsnake-web
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Contract test fixtures committed to tests/fixtures/ directory (8 JSON files)
  - ✅ README documents fixtures in "Contract Test Fixtures" section
  - ✅ Tests run successfully: 41 tests pass including 14 fixture validation tests
- Fixtures include: frame.json, level.json, and 6 error type examples
- Files reviewed: gsnake-web/tests/fixtures/, gsnake-web/tests/contract/fixtures.test.ts, gsnake-web/README.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-011 was already completed in previous work
  - Fixtures are duplicated from gsnake-core to enable standalone builds
  - Contract tests validate TypeScript types match Rust-generated JSON structure
  - This ensures type safety between WASM backend and TypeScript frontend
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-012
- Verified that gsnake-web/.github/workflows/ci.yml already exists with complete CI workflow
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ CI workflow with three jobs: build, typecheck, test (all jobs include npm ci for install)
  - ✅ Compatible with nektos/act (uses standard actions: actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-node@v4)
  - ✅ Triggers configured: push to main, pull requests, workflow_dispatch (lines 3-8)
  - ✅ Built-in npm caching via actions/setup-node@v4 (cache-dependency-path: gsnake-web/package-lock.json)
- Quality checks verified: npm run check (0 errors, 0 warnings), npm test (41 tests passed)
- Files reviewed: gsnake-web/.github/workflows/ci.yml
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-012 was already completed in previous work (commit 9b94377, though message said US-013)
  - The CI workflow is designed for standalone mode: preinstall script switches to git dependency automatically
  - In standalone CI, npm fetches prebuilt WASM artifacts from main branch via git dependency
  - actions/setup-node@v4 includes built-in npm caching using cache-dependency-path parameter
  - Each job (build, typecheck, test) runs npm ci independently, ensuring clean install for parallel execution
  - gsnake-web is a git submodule, so changes must be committed within the submodule directory
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-013
- Updated gsnake-web/README.md with comprehensive standalone build instructions
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Standalone build requirements documented (Node.js 18+, npm, git, prebuilt WASM)
  - ✅ Auto-detection behavior documented with clear detection logic and mode explanations
  - ✅ Troubleshooting section added with 7 common issues and solutions
- Files changed: gsnake-web/README.md
- Quality checks passed: npm run check succeeded (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - README structure should mirror implementation: standalone instructions first, then auto-detection details
  - Troubleshooting sections should use Problem/Cause/Solution format for clarity
  - Document both "what happens" (technical behavior) and "how to use" (user commands)
  - Git dependency syntax for subdirectories: git+https://repo.git#branch:path/to/subdir
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-014
- Configured gsnake-editor for standalone build with proper testing infrastructure
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - Environment variable support already existed: VITE_GSNAKE_WEB_URL with default http://localhost:3000
  - No hardcoded sibling path references to gsnake-web found
  - Verified all build commands work in standalone mode
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-editor/package.json: Added test scripts (test, test:watch, test:ui)
  - gsnake-editor/package-lock.json: Added Vitest, @vitest/ui, happy-dom dependencies
  - gsnake-editor/vitest.config.ts: New Vitest configuration with Svelte plugin
  - gsnake-editor/src/tests/types.test.ts: Basic unit tests
  - gsnake-editor/src/tests/integration.test.ts: Integration tests with connectivity checks
- Quality checks: All pass (npm install, build, check, test all succeed)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gsnake-editor already had proper environment variable support via Vite (VITE_ prefix required)
  - Integration tests should fail gracefully with informative messages when dependencies unavailable
  - Vitest is well-suited for Svelte projects with happy-dom environment
  - Unit tests (4/4 pass) verify basic functionality and environment variable access
  - Integration tests check gsnake-web connectivity and skip gracefully if unreachable with clear warning messages
  - The .env.example file documents the VITE_GSNAKE_WEB_URL variable
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-015
- Added test job to gsnake-editor CI workflow
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ CI workflow with three jobs: build, typecheck, test (unit only)
  - ✅ Compatible with nektos/act (uses standard actions)
  - ✅ Workflow runs on: push to main, pull requests, workflow_dispatch
- CI workflow already existed but was missing the test job
- Files changed: gsnake-editor/.github/workflows/ci.yml
- Quality checks passed: npm run build, npm run check, npm test all succeed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The CI workflow was partially complete - needed test job to meet all acceptance criteria
  - All three jobs (build, typecheck, test) run npm ci independently for parallel execution
  - Test job runs unit tests only - integration tests gracefully skip when gsnake-web unreachable
  - gsnake-editor is a git submodule, so changes must be committed within the submodule directory first
  - Workflow follows same pattern as gsnake-web: checkout to submodule path, cache npm, run commands with working-directory
---
## 2026-01-29 - US-016
- Updated gsnake-editor/README.md with comprehensive standalone build documentation
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Documented standalone build with two testing options: run gsnake-web locally or set VITE_GSNAKE_WEB_URL
  - ✅ Documented integration test setup with clear examples for both local and remote gsnake-web
  - ✅ Added troubleshooting section with 4 common issues: integration tests skipped, build failures, dev server issues, type checking failures
- Files changed: gsnake-editor/README.md (added 111 lines)
- Quality checks passed: npm run check succeeded (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Standalone build documentation should clearly separate unit tests (always work) from integration tests (require external service)
  - Integration test documentation should provide both local and remote setup options for flexibility
  - Troubleshooting sections should use Problem/Cause/Solution format for clarity
  - README structure should progress from prerequisites → installation → building → testing → troubleshooting
  - Documentation should explain graceful degradation (unit tests pass even when integration tests are skipped)
---

## 2026-01-29 - US-017
- Verified gsnake-specs standalone build status
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ All references to sibling repos are documentation references (explaining how dependency resolution works), not build dependencies
  - ✅ No mkdocs build (not applicable - pure Markdown documentation)
  - ✅ No Python dependencies (no requirements.txt or pyproject.toml files)
  - ✅ CI workflow exists at .github/workflows/ci.yml with three jobs: markdown-lint, link-check, validate
  - ✅ Repository structure validated: 66 Markdown files, all 11 key directories present
- Files reviewed: gsnake-specs/README.md, gsnake-specs/.github/workflows/ci.yml, gsnake-specs/.markdown-link-check.json
- Quality checks: Structure validation passed, all directories exist
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gsnake-specs is unique among submodules - it's pure documentation with no build process
  - The README already documents standalone build status comprehensively
  - References to `../gsnake-core` and `file:../` in docs are examples explaining other submodules' behavior, not dependencies
  - gsnake-specs has no npm/cargo/pip dependencies - it's immediately usable after clone
  - CI workflow validates Markdown quality, link integrity, and repository structure
  - This was a verification-only story - no code changes needed
---
## 2026-01-29 - US-021
- Documented root repo override mechanism in root README.md
- Added comprehensive "Local Development Overrides" section to gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md
- Files changed:
  - README.md: Expanded Submodule Dependency Resolution section (+83 lines)
  - gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md: Added Local Development Overrides section (+190 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The detection mechanism is implemented differently in Rust (build.rs with .cargo/config.toml patch) vs JavaScript (preinstall script modifying package.json)
  - Root repo detection script at scripts/detect-repo-context.sh exports GSNAKE_ROOT_REPO and path variables
  - Documentation should explain both "how it works" (implementation) and "how to use" (user perspective)
  - Include verification commands (cargo tree, npm ls) to help debug which mode is active
  - Troubleshooting sections should address both detection failures and forced standalone testing
  - Submodule commits must happen within the submodule directory first, then root repo updates the pointer
---
## 2026-01-29 - US-022
- Documented nektos/act testing for all CI workflows in root README.md
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Added "Testing CI Locally" section with comprehensive documentation
  - ✅ Installation instructions for macOS, Linux, and Windows
  - ✅ Usage examples for all five submodules with specific job commands
  - ✅ Known limitations documented (Docker requirement, cache behavior, WASM build speed, link checking issues)
  - ✅ Alternative manual testing commands provided for environments without act
- Files changed: README.md (+95 lines), prd.json (marked US-022 as passing)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All workflows use standard GitHub Actions that are nektos/act compatible
  - act requires Docker to be installed and running locally
  - Each submodule has different job names based on its technology stack (build/test/wasm for Rust, build/typecheck/test for JavaScript)
  - gsnake-specs has unique jobs: markdown-lint, link-check, validate
  - Documentation should include both automated (act) and manual testing approaches
  - Known limitations help set expectations for developers trying to run CI locally
  - Installation instructions should cover all major platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
---
## 2026-01-29 - US-023
- Completed comprehensive architecture documentation in gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Two dependency modes already documented (Standalone git URLs, Root repo local paths)
  - ✅ Mermaid diagram already shows conditional dependency resolution
  - ✅ Added "Building Standalone Submodules" section with prerequisites and build instructions for all 5 submodules
  - ✅ Added "CI/CD Strategy" section documenting all workflows, design principles, and nektos/act compatibility
  - ✅ Added "Status and Milestones" section marking 5 resolved pain points (WEB, LEVELS, EDITOR builds, CI, docs)
  - ✅ Linked to each submodule's README.md for detailed build instructions
  - ✅ Documented versioning strategy (root repo semver, submodules track main branch)
  - ✅ Updated future goals section declaring feature complete
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md (+372 lines, now 818 lines total)
  - Root repo: prd.json (marked US-023 as passing), gsnake-specs submodule pointer
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Architecture documentation should be structured: Overview → Strategy → Implementation → Troubleshooting → Status
  - "Building Standalone Submodules" provides concrete examples for each technology stack (Rust, JavaScript, Markdown)
  - CI/CD documentation should explain both what each workflow does AND the design principles behind them
  - Status section with resolved pain points gives clear before/after comparison
  - Versioning model section clarifies different approaches: root repo (semver) vs submodules (main branch tracking) vs local dev (filesystem)
  - Future goals should state when features are complete, not just list aspirational items
  - Documentation file grew from 446 to 818 lines - comprehensive coverage achieved
---
## 2026-01-30 - US-005
- Added @testing-library/svelte, @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom as dev dependencies to gsnake-editor
- Updated vitest.config.ts to use jsdom environment instead of happy-dom
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ vitest, @testing-library/svelte, @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom installed as dev dependencies
  - ✅ Test script already exists in package.json: vitest run
  - ✅ vitest.config.ts updated with environment: 'jsdom'
  - ✅ npm install succeeded (64 new packages added)
  - ✅ npm test runs successfully (4/4 tests passing)
  - ✅ Typecheck passes (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-editor/package.json (added testing library dependencies)
  - gsnake-editor/package-lock.json (dependency tree updated)
  - gsnake-editor/vitest.config.ts (changed environment from happy-dom to jsdom)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gsnake-editor already had test infrastructure with vitest and happy-dom
  - The PRD required specific testing libraries (@testing-library/svelte, @testing-library/jest-dom) and jsdom environment
  - Testing library provides better utilities for testing Svelte components than basic vitest
  - jsdom is the standard DOM implementation for Node.js testing, while happy-dom is a lighter alternative
  - gsnake-editor is a submodule - changes must be committed in the submodule first, then root repo updates the pointer
  - The existing test suite already has 4 tests (2 type tests, 2 integration tests that gracefully skip when gsnake-web unreachable)
---

## 2026-01-30 - US-001 & US-002
- Verified that gsnake-levels already has comprehensive test coverage
- All acceptance criteria met for both stories:
  - ✅ US-001: Unit tests for resolve_playback_path exist in verify.rs (lines 70-150, 8 tests)
  - ✅ US-001: Unit tests for load_playback_directions exist in playback.rs (lines 70-226, 9 tests)
  - ✅ US-001: Tests use repo fixtures from levels/ and playbacks/ directories
  - ✅ US-001: Tests verified to not mutate files (integration_test.rs:19-42)
  - ✅ US-002: Integration test exists in tests/integration_test.rs (3 tests)
  - ✅ US-002: Test verifies levels/easy/level_001.json with playbacks/easy/level_001.json
  - ✅ US-002: All 20 tests pass (17 unit + 3 integration)
- Files reviewed:
  - gsnake-levels/src/verify.rs
  - gsnake-levels/src/playback.rs
  - gsnake-levels/tests/integration_test.rs
  - gsnake-levels/src/lib.rs
- Test run: cargo test passed with 20 tests total
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gsnake-levels already has excellent test coverage from previous work
  - Unit tests are inline in module files using #[cfg(test)] blocks
  - Integration tests are in separate tests/ directory and can access public modules via lib.rs exports
  - Tests properly handle optional file existence checks (if level_path.exists())
  - The test suite covers both happy paths and error cases (invalid JSON, missing files, etc.)
---

## 2026-01-30 - US-003
- Created GitHub Actions test workflow for gsnake-levels
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Created gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/test.yml
  - ✅ Workflow triggers on push and pull_request
  - ✅ Workflow uses ubuntu-latest only
  - ✅ Workflow installs Rust with dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
  - ✅ Workflow checks out gsnake-levels into gsnake-levels/
  - ✅ Workflow checks out NNTin/gSnake into gsnake-root/
  - ✅ Workflow creates symlink gsnake-core -> gsnake-root/gsnake-core
  - ✅ Workflow runs cargo test with working-directory: gsnake-levels
  - ✅ Workflow uses only public actions (actions/checkout@v4, dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable)
  - ✅ Tests pass locally (20 tests: 17 unit + 3 integration)
- Files changed: gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/test.yml (new, 32 lines)
- Committed to gsnake-levels submodule: commit ea40946
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gsnake-levels is a git submodule - changes must be committed inside the submodule directory first
  - The workflow uses the root repo approach with symlinks (not standalone git dependencies)
  - The symlink approach ensures tests run against the current state of gsnake-core in the root repo
  - This differs from the existing ci.yml which uses standalone mode with git dependencies
  - Both approaches are valid: ci.yml for standalone validation, test.yml for integrated testing
---

## 2026-01-30 - US-004
- Tested gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/test.yml with nektos/act
- Workflow structure validated successfully:
  - ✅ Workflow uses catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest image
  - ✅ First step (Checkout gsnake-levels) completes successfully
  - ✅ Setup Rust step initializes correctly
- **Known limitation identified:**
  - act requires a valid GitHub token to checkout external repositories (NNTin/gSnake)
  - Command tested: `act -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest -W .github/workflows/test.yml`
  - Error: "Input required and not supplied: token" when checking out NNTin/gSnake
  - Workaround: Users must provide GITHUB_TOKEN via `--secret GITHUB_TOKEN="<token>"`
- Files reviewed: gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/test.yml
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - act has a known limitation: cannot checkout external repositories without a valid GitHub token
  - The workflow itself is correctly structured and compatible with act
  - Local checkout steps work fine, but external repo checkouts require authentication
  - To run successfully: `act -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest -W .github/workflows/test.yml --secret GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-token>"`
  - Alternative: Use GitHub's actual CI for testing workflows that checkout external repos
  - The test.yml workflow differs from ci.yml: test.yml uses root repo approach, ci.yml uses standalone git dependencies
---

## 2026-01-30 - US-005 (continued)
- Completed final acceptance criteria for US-005
- Added missing dependencies:
  - ✅ supertest and @types/supertest for server API testing
- Updated vitest.config.ts:
  - ✅ Changed environment from 'happy-dom' to 'jsdom' (as specified in PRD)
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-editor/package.json (added supertest dependencies)

- Quality checks passed:
  - ✅ npm test: 8 tests passing
  - ✅ npm run check: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Committed to gsnake-editor submodule: commit 4c3b7a1
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PRD specified jsdom explicitly, while previous iteration used happy-dom
  - supertest is essential for testing Express server endpoints without starting a real server
  - @types/supertest provides TypeScript type definitions for supertest
  - All acceptance criteria from PRD must be verified, even if similar work was done previously
  - jsdom is heavier but more compatible with browser APIs than happy-dom
---

## 2026-01-30 - US-006
- Verified that gsnake-editor UI component tests already exist and pass
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Test file src/tests/LandingPage.test.ts renders LandingPage.svelte component
  - ✅ Test imports from @testing-library/svelte (render, screen)
  - ✅ Test imports @testing-library/jest-dom for assertions
  - ✅ Test uses screen queries: getByRole, getByText for visible elements
  - ✅ Test validates heading, description, and both buttons are in the document
  - ✅ npm test passes: 8 tests total (2 types, 2 integration, 4 LandingPage)
  - ✅ npm run check passes: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Files reviewed: gsnake-editor/src/tests/LandingPage.test.ts, gsnake-editor/src/lib/LandingPage.svelte
- Test was already committed in 50ced21
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - LandingPage.test.ts was created in previous iteration, already committed to main branch
  - Test suite uses @testing-library/svelte with jsdom environment for realistic browser DOM simulation
  - Screen queries (getByRole, getByText) provide accessible, user-centric test assertions
  - Integration tests gracefully skip when gsnake-web is unreachable, showing helpful warning messages
  - The gsnake-editor submodule pointer 4c3b7a1 includes commit 50ced21, so US-006 work is already present

## 2026-01-30 - US-007
- Verified that gsnake-editor server.ts already exports the Express app for testing
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ server.ts exports the Express app instance (line 77: export { app })
  - ✅ server.listen() moved to conditional block (lines 81-91)
  - ✅ Server starts correctly when run directly using import.meta.url check
  - ✅ Typecheck passes: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Files reviewed: gsnake-editor/server.ts
- Refactoring was already committed in db808ac
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The conditional server start uses import.meta.url to detect if module is main entry point
  - This pattern works with ES modules and TypeScript: `import.meta.url.endsWith(process.argv[1])`
  - Exporting the app separately from starting the server enables testing with supertest
  - The app remains fully functional when imported (all routes and middleware configured)
  - This is the standard pattern for testable Express apps in ES module projects
