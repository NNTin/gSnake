## Codebase Patterns
- CI results stored in scripts/test/result.txt (scripts/test/test_act.sh automatically run each iteration)
- Individual job logs in scripts/test/tmp_act_results/ with .log and .status files
- Test with act: act -W <workflow-path> -j <job-name> --container-architecture linux/amd64
- Submodules: gsnake-web, gsnake-editor, gsnake-levels, gsnake-specs
- Workflows use FORCE_GIT_DEPS=true for standalone mode testing
- Full test suite runs with scripts/test/test_act.sh (30+ minutes)
- the full test suite runs using pushed code on remote, so unpushed code are not reflected in the run. git push after committing.

## 2026-01-30 20:25 - US-001
- Fixed TypeScript type errors in gsnake-web/scripts/detect-local-deps.js
- Added JSDoc type annotations for `targetDependency` and `label` parameters in updateDependency function
- Excluded vendor directory from tsconfig.json to prevent type errors in generated WASM files
- Verified typecheck passes with: cd gsnake-web && npm run check
- Files changed: gsnake-web/scripts/detect-local-deps.js, gsnake-web/tsconfig.json

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The gsnake-web typecheck uses `npm run check` which runs `svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.json`
- Generated/vendored code (like WASM bindings) should be excluded from TypeScript checking
- JSDoc type annotations are sufficient for fixing implicit 'any' errors in JavaScript files
- The repository structure has gsnake-web as a git submodule, so changes need to be committed in the submodule first, then the submodule reference updated in the root repo
---
## 2026-01-30 21:25 - US-002
- Verified typecheck now passes in deploy workflow validate job
- Fix from US-001 (gsnake-web TypeScript type annotations) resolved this issue
- Tested with: act -W .github/workflows/deploy.yml -j validate --container-architecture linux/amd64
- Typecheck step output: "svelte-check found 0 errors and 0 warnings"
- Files changed: scripts/ralph/prd.json (marked US-002 as passing)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Deploy workflow validate job runs the same typecheck as gsnake-web CI: `npm --prefix gsnake-web run check`
- The validate job includes multiple steps: typecheck, Rust contract tests, TypeScript contract tests, E2E contract tests
- The typecheck passes, but E2E tests in the validate job are failing (14 failed tests) - this is a separate issue
- Note: US-002 acceptance criteria is about typecheck passing, not the entire validate job passing

## 2026-01-30 22:30 - US-003
- Fixed gsnake-levels test workflow Cargo.toml path issue
- Added directory resolution logic to test.yml workflow to handle different checkout scenarios (act vs GitHub Actions)
- Fixed build.rs to create .cargo directory before writing config.toml
- Files changed: 
  - gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/test.yml (added directory resolution step)
  - gsnake-levels/build.rs (added fs::create_dir_all before writing config)
- Verified with: act -W gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/test.yml -j test --container-architecture linux/amd64
- Test results: 17 unit tests passed + 3 integration tests passed

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The act tool (nektos/act) handles checkout differently than GitHub Actions - it copies the entire repo instead of just the submodule
- The ci.yml workflow (which passes) uses a "Resolve directory" pattern that checks multiple candidate paths: ".", "submodule-name", "submodule-name/submodule-name"
- This pattern sets an env var (LEVELS_DIR) and uses it in all subsequent steps with working-directory: ${{ env.LEVELS_DIR }}
- Build scripts that write to .cargo/config.toml must create the .cargo directory first with fs::create_dir_all
- When fixing CI workflows, check if similar workflows already exist (ci.yml) and reuse their patterns
- The act tool (nektos/act) checkouts the remote repository. Local unpushed changes are not seen.

## 2026-01-30 23:05 - US-004
- Fixed gsnake-web test workflow path resolution issues
- Added directory resolution logic similar to gsnake-levels (checks ".", "gsnake-web", "gsnake-web/gsnake-web")
- Removed problematic scripts symlink that was overwriting local gsnake-web/scripts directory
- Added dynamic ROOT_REL_PATH calculation based on WEB_DIR depth (handles ../../gsnake-root vs ../gsnake-root)
- Added Configure dependencies step to run detect-local-deps.js before npm install
- Changed npm ci to npm install to ensure preinstall hook runs and all dependencies install correctly
- Fixed Build WASM step to reference build_wasm.py from gsnake-root using calculated relative path
- Verified with: act -W gsnake-web/.github/workflows/test.yml -j test --container-architecture linux/amd64
- Test results: 3 test files, 41 tests, all passing
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-web/.github/workflows/test.yml
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The test.yml workflow tests with the root repo structure (different from ci.yml which uses FORCE_GIT_DEPS)
- Creating a symlink overwrites/hides the target directory - don't symlink directories that have their own content
- detect-local-deps.js is in gsnake-web/scripts/, not root scripts/, so the scripts symlink was hiding it
- The directory resolution pattern from gsnake-levels works well: check multiple candidates and set env var
- When WEB_DIR = "gsnake-web/gsnake-web", need ../../gsnake-root; when "gsnake-web", need ../gsnake-root
- npm ci skips preinstall scripts, use npm install if you need preinstall to run
- The workflow structure: checkout -> resolve directory -> setup tools -> symlinks -> build WASM -> configure deps -> install -> test
---
## 2026-01-30 23:10 - US-005
- Fixed gsnake-specs test workflow directory resolution
- Added directory resolution logic similar to gsnake-web and gsnake-levels
- Changed candidate check order to prioritize gsnake-specs/gsnake-specs over gsnake-specs
- Added .mlc.json file check to distinguish gsnake-specs package.json from root package.json
- The root repo has its own package.json without lint:md and check:links scripts
- Updated all working-directory references to use SPECS_DIR environment variable
- Verified with: act -W gsnake-specs/.github/workflows/test.yml -j test --container-architecture linux/amd64
- Both markdown lint and link check now pass successfully
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-specs/.github/workflows/test.yml
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When multiple package.json files exist (root and submodule), need a unique file to distinguish them
- Used .mlc.json (markdown-link-check config) as the unique identifier for gsnake-specs
- The order of candidates matters - check the most nested path first to avoid matching the wrong file
- Pattern: for candidate in "path/path" "path" "." ensures we find the deepest match first
- Root repo package.json has test:e2e and report scripts, not markdown validation scripts

## 2026-01-31 01:30 - US-006
- Investigated E2E test failures - 14 tests timing out waiting for page elements (.cell)
- Root cause: Playwright webServer configuration was too complex and fragile
- vite build was hanging/failing silently after printing "/index.css doesn't exist", preventing preview server from starting
- Solution attempt 1: Moved build steps from webServer command to CI workflow steps
  - Added separate workflow steps for: Build fixture WASM, Setup gsnake-web (npm ci, build), Setup gsnake-editor (npm ci)
  - Simplified webServer config to just run preview/dev commands
- Solution attempt 2: Started servers in workflow background jobs instead of Playwright webServer
  - Added workflow steps to start servers with & and verify with curl --retry
  - Configure Playwright to reuse existing servers in CI mode (reuseExistingServer: true)
  - Servers now start successfully: localhost:3000 (vite preview) and localhost:3003 (editor dev)
- Current status: PARTIALLY RESOLVED
  - ✅ Web servers now start correctly in CI
  - ✅ Workflow build steps work (WASM builds, npm tests pass, vite builds successfully)
  - ❌ Tests still fail with .cell timeout - page loads but game doesn't render
  - ❌ Editor API server on port 3001 not starting properly (ECONNREFUSED errors)
- Files changed:
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml (added build steps, server startup)
  - playwright.config.ts (simplified webServer config, CI mode detection)
  - scripts/test/result.txt (test results)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Playwright webServer command has issues in CI/Docker environments with complex chained commands
- Long && chains can fail silently if any step hangs (vite build was hanging after index.css warning)
- Better approach: Run build/setup in workflow steps, start servers in background, use Playwright's reuseExistingServer
- The webServer command chain './scripts/build_fixture_wasm.sh && npm ci && npm build && npm preview' was too fragile
- Starting servers in workflow with `command &` works, but need to ensure they're fully ready before tests run
- curl --retry --retry-connrefused is good for verifying HTTP server readiness
- E2E tests still require deeper debugging: page loads but WASM/JS doesn't initialize game properly
- This is likely a different issue from server startup - possibly WASM loading failure or JS runtime error in CI environment
- The fact that API tests pass (complete-workflow.spec.ts) confirms servers start, but UI rendering fails
---
## 2026-01-31 09:05 - US-006
- Fixed E2E test failures where game grid (.cell elements) wasn't rendering
- Root cause: WASM engine's onFrame callback only fires when processMove() is called, NOT during initialization
- The initial frame was never emitted, so the Svelte frame store remained empty and no cells rendered
- Solution: Added explicit getFrame() call after creating the WASM engine in loadLevelByIndex()
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-web/engine/WasmGameEngine.ts (added getFrame() call and emit initial frame)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (marked US-006 as passing)
  
**Learnings for future iterations:**
- WASM bindings: The WasmGameEngine.onFrame(callback) only fires when processMove() is called
- Initial state must be explicitly fetched using getFrame() and emitted as a 'frameChanged' event
- The page header/UI can load successfully (showing Level, Length, Moves from 'levelChanged' event) but grid won't render without 'frameChanged' event
- Svelte reactive statements ($: grid = $frame?.grid ?? []) depend on the frame store being populated
- When debugging "element not found" E2E errors, check Playwright's error-context.md files for page snapshots - they show what elements exist vs. what's missing
- The error context showed buttons and stats rendering but no .cell elements, indicating partial initialization
- The WasmGameEngine TypeScript wrapper exposes getFrame(), getGameState(), and getLevel() methods for accessing current state
