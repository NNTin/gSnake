## Codebase Patterns
- **Git Dependencies**: Use branch-based git dependencies for submodules (not tags/commits)
- **Auto-detection**: Build scripts check for ../.git and sibling submodules to detect root repo context
- **Rust Overrides**: Use .cargo/config.toml with [patch] section to override git deps with local paths
- **JavaScript Overrides**: Use preinstall scripts to dynamically modify package.json based on detection
- **CI Strategy**: Per-submodule CI validates standalone builds; root CI validates integration
- **nektos/act**: Use act for local CI testing - compatible with standard GitHub Actions
- **Documentation Location**: gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md is the central doc for dependency architecture
- **"Typecheck passes"**: For markdown-only changes, this means ensuring valid markdown syntax (no specific command)

## 2026-01-27 22:15 - US-001
- Implemented comprehensive "Dependency Resolution Strategy" section in gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md
- Files changed: gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The repo-architecture.md file is the central documentation for dependency management
  - Documentation should include both Rust (Cargo.toml) and JavaScript (package.json) examples
  - Auto-detection mechanism is a key feature: checks for ../.git to determine root repo context
  - Acceptance criteria "Typecheck passes" refers to ensuring markdown syntax is valid (no specific typecheck command in root)

## 2026-01-27 22:17 - US-002
- Implemented comprehensive "Troubleshooting" section in gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md
- Files changed: gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Troubleshooting section covers 5 main categories: git deps not found, local override not working, WASM build fails, forcing standalone mode, verifying dependency mode
  - Each troubleshooting item includes symptoms, causes/solutions, and verification commands
  - Important to provide both Rust and JavaScript examples for verification commands

## 2026-01-27 22:20 - US-003
- Updated architecture Mermaid diagram in gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md
- Files changed: gsnake-specs/tasks/repo-architecture.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Mermaid diagram now clearly shows two modes: Root Repository (local paths) and Standalone (git deps)
  - Used emojis (🏠 and 🌐) and color coding to visually distinguish the modes
  - Removed old "cannot build alone" pain points - now marked as resolved
  - Added legend explaining dependency types
  - Diagram is more focused and easier to understand than the previous version
