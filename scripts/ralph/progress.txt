## Codebase Patterns
- For `gsnake-levels validate-levels-toml`, keep validation output aggregated and deterministic (`[io]`, `[parse]`, `[validation]` with numbered lines) so one run reports all actionable issues and tests can assert stable CLI output.
- For `gsnake-levels` playback generation, keep `sync-metadata` and `solve_level` aligned through `solver::solve_level_to_playback(...)` so playback JSON format cannot drift and per-level `cargo` subprocess overhead is avoided.
- In `gsnake-core` stone push logic, keep `stone_mechanics::is_space_available` aligned with gravity occupancy rules by treating all food variants plus the exit tile as blocking cells.

## [2026-02-20 09:55:34 CET] - US-001
- Implemented US-001 by updating `stone_mechanics::is_space_available` to block stone pushes into regular food, floating food, falling food, and the exit tile.
- Added regression tests covering blocked pushes into `food`, `floating_food`, `falling_food`, and the exit tile (including `exit_is_solid = false` behavior).
- Ran quality checks in `gsnake-core`: `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy -p gsnake-core --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test -p gsnake-core`.
- Files changed: `gsnake-core/engine/core/src/stone_mechanics.rs`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Stone push occupancy rules should mirror gravity support rules to avoid divergent behavior between horizontal pushes and vertical settling.
  - `stone_mechanics` unit tests are the fastest regression surface for push-blocking semantics; keep focused tests there when adding occupancy constraints.
  - `cargo test -p gsnake-core` covers both unit and contract/property suites relevant to engine behavior changes.
