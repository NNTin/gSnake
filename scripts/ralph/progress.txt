## Codebase Patterns
- For gsnake-web enum contract drift checks, keep runtime enum guard constants in `gsnake-web/packages/gsnake-web-app/contracts/enumGuards.ts` and assert parity against both generated TS unions (`types/models.ts`) and Rust wire enums (`gsnake-core/engine/core/src/models.rs`) so cross-language mismatch fails tests.
- For `gsnake-wasm` in `WasmGameEngine.ts`, import as a namespace and treat the default initializer as optional because generated `pkg/gsnake_wasm.js` may omit a default export while unit-test mocks still provide one.
- For `gsnake-editor/src/tests/integration.test.ts`, keep live endpoint checks opt-in with `GSNAKE_EDITOR_LIVE_INTEGRATION=1` and use explicit `it.skip` semantics by default, so CI avoids false-green placeholder assertions while enabled runs still enforce real HTTP contract checks.

## [2026-02-20 11:00:51 CET] - US-001
- Replaced tautological enum contract tests with runtime assertions backed by production guard arrays and cross-checked against generated TS unions plus Rust enum serialization names.
- Added reusable runtime enum guard constants/type guards and updated WASM import initialization handling to satisfy package typecheck without relying on a guaranteed default export.
- Files changed: `gsnake-web/packages/gsnake-web-app/contracts/enumGuards.ts`, `gsnake-web/packages/gsnake-web-app/tests/contract/enums.test.ts`, `gsnake-web/packages/gsnake-web-app/engine/WasmGameEngine.ts`, `gsnake-web/packages/gsnake-web-app/engine/CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Runtime enum contract tests are strongest when they compare three sources: production guard arrays, generated TS bindings, and Rust enum wire values.
  - `gsnake-wasm` module shape can differ between generated artifacts and mocks; default initializer should be feature-detected before calling.
  - `npm run check` for `gsnake-web-app` catches module-shape/type issues that `vitest` can miss due to mocking.

## [2026-02-20 11:05:37 CET] - US-002
- Reworked editor integration tests to remove unconditional pass fallbacks and replaced them with explicit opt-in skip semantics plus strict runtime assertions against `VITE_GSNAKE_WEB_URL` and `?test=true` route contracts.
- Files changed: `gsnake-editor/src/tests/integration.test.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Live cross-service checks in unit-test suites should be opt-in and skipped explicitly when the environment is not provisioned, instead of passing vacuously.
  - Integration assertions should validate concrete response contracts (status/content-type/app shell marker) so endpoint regressions produce a hard failure.
  - `npm --prefix gsnake-editor run check`, `npm --prefix gsnake-editor run lint`, and `npm --prefix gsnake-editor test` provide sufficient local quality gates for editor test-only changes.
