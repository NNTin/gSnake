# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Sun Jan 25 18:22:51 CET 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- **Svelte Reactivity**: Trigger reactivity after mutations with reassignment: `cells = cells`
- **Component Communication**: Use createEventDispatcher with TypeScript generics for type-safe parent-child events
- **Types Location**: Export types from separate .ts files (e.g., types.ts), not from .svelte files
- **Modal Pattern**: Fixed position overlay with rgba background + centered card with white background, 12px border-radius, box-shadow
- **Entity Colors**: Consistent color scheme across components (snake=#4caf50, obstacle=#666, food=#ff9800, etc.)
- **Grid Rendering**: Use CSS Grid with dynamic grid-template-columns, 32px cells, 1px gaps, background color shows as gaps
- **Typecheck Command**: `npm run check` in gsnake-editor runs svelte-check and tsc
- **Browser MCP Limitation**: Browser MCP tool has timeout issues with clicks; rely on typecheck and code verification for correctness

## Sat Jan 25 18:27:00 CET 2026 - US-001
- Implemented project setup and build configuration for gsnake-editor
- Created gsnake-editor/ directory with Vite + Svelte + TypeScript
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-editor/.gitignore (new)
  - gsnake-editor/package.json (new)
  - gsnake-editor/vite.config.ts (new)
  - gsnake-editor/tsconfig.*.json (new)
  - gsnake-editor/src/* (scaffolded Svelte app)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (new - converted PRD from markdown)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The gsnake project is organized into multiple sub-projects (gsnake-core, gsnake-web, gsnake-levels, gsnake-specs, gsnake-editor)
  - Vite template scaffolding already includes all necessary configuration (build output, dev server, npm scripts, .gitignore)
  - TypeScript check script is `npm run check` which runs svelte-check and tsc
  - Dev server runs on port 5173 by default
  - The PRD was initially in markdown format at gsnake-specs/tasks/prd-level-editor.md and needed to be converted to JSON format

## Sun Jan 25 18:42:00 CET 2026 - US-002
- Implemented landing page with level creation options
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/LandingPage.svelte (new)
  - gsnake-editor/src/App.svelte (modified)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated US-002 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The landing page uses Svelte's event dispatcher pattern for component communication
  - File picker for JSON upload is handled by creating a hidden input element programmatically
  - Modal overlay pattern: fixed position with rgba background, centered content with flex
  - Browser testing tools (MCP browser) work well for verifying UI implementations
  - The gsnake-editor uses a centered white card design pattern with shadow and rounded corners
  - Event handlers in Svelte use on:eventName syntax, custom events use createEventDispatcher
---

## Sun Jan 25 18:55:00 CET 2026 - US-003
- Implemented grid size configuration modal with width/height inputs
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/GridSizeModal.svelte (new)
  - gsnake-editor/src/App.svelte (modified - integrated modal)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated US-003 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Modal components in Svelte follow a consistent pattern: overlay + centered card with createEventDispatcher
  - Input validation can be done both client-side (min/max attributes) and in event handlers
  - Number inputs with bind:value work well for numeric configuration
  - The modal styling is consistent across the app: white background, border-radius: 12px, box-shadow, rgba overlay
  - Event handlers receive CustomEvent<T> typed parameters when using typed createEventDispatcher
  - Browser MCP tool had some timeout issues with clicks, but screenshots confirm UI works correctly
---

## Sun Jan 25 19:10:00 CET 2026 - US-004
- Implemented editor interface layout with toolbar, sidebar, and canvas area
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/EditorLayout.svelte (new)
  - gsnake-editor/src/App.svelte (modified - added editor routing)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated US-004 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The editor uses a three-part layout: toolbar (top), sidebar (left, 200px fixed), canvas (center, flex-1)
  - Toolbar buttons are placeholder handlers that will be implemented in future stories
  - The App.svelte component manages view state (showEditor flag) to switch between landing page and editor
  - Grid dimensions are passed as props from App to EditorLayout
  - Flexbox with height: 100vh and overflow: hidden prevents layout issues
  - The canvas area uses flex: 1 with overflow: auto to enable scrolling for large grids
  - Browser MCP testing sometimes has timeout issues with click events, but keyboard navigation (Tab + Enter) works reliably
  - Taking screenshots is more reliable than waiting for snapshot updates after interactions

## Sun Jan 25 19:25:00 CET 2026 - US-005
- Implemented entity palette component with all 8 entity types
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/EntityPalette.svelte (new)
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/types.ts (new)
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/EditorLayout.svelte (modified - integrated EntityPalette)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated US-005 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Svelte doesn't allow exporting types from .svelte files - types must be in separate .ts files
  - The types.ts file is used to share EntityType and Entity types across components
  - Entity palette uses a button list with colored icons and selection state
  - Selected state is shown with a colored border matching the entity's color using CSS custom properties
  - The createEventDispatcher<{ select: EntityType }> pattern provides type-safe custom events
  - Snake entity is selected by default on component load
  - Entity colors from PRD: snake=#4caf50, obstacle=#666, food=#ff9800, exit=#2196f3, stone=#9e9e9e, spike=#f44336, floating-food=#ffc107, falling-food=#ff5722

## Sun Jan 25 19:45:00 CET 2026 - US-006
- Implemented grid rendering component with configurable dimensions
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/GridCanvas.svelte (new)
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/EditorLayout.svelte (modified - integrated GridCanvas)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated US-006 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Grid rendering uses CSS Grid with dynamic grid-template-columns calculated in inline styles
  - Each cell is 32x32 pixels with 1px gaps achieved using grid gap property
  - The grid background color (#e0e0e0) shows through the gaps between white cells
  - Total grid dimensions are calculated reactively: width = gridWidth * CELL_SIZE + (gridWidth - 1) * GRID_GAP
  - Grid wrapper has white background, 12px border-radius, shadow for consistent card design pattern
  - Canvas area in EditorLayout uses flexbox centering (align-items/justify-content: center) with overflow: auto for scrolling
  - Cell data attributes (data-row, data-col) are added for future click handling in US-007
  - Browser MCP tools sometimes have timeout issues with clicks, but code verification and typecheck are reliable
---

## Sun Jan 25 20:30:00 CET 2026 - US-007
- Implemented click-to-place functionality for entity placement on grid
- Files changed:
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/types.ts (added GridCell interface)
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/GridCanvas.svelte (added click handlers, entity colors, event dispatcher)
  - gsnake-editor/src/lib/EditorLayout.svelte (added grid state management, cell click handler)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (updated US-007 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Grid state is managed in EditorLayout as a 2D array of GridCell objects with entity property
  - Svelte reactivity requires reassignment to trigger updates: `cells = cells` after mutation
  - Event dispatcher pattern used for child-to-parent communication: GridCanvas dispatches cellClick to EditorLayout
  - Entity colors are duplicated in GridCanvas (for rendering) and EntityPalette (for palette display) - could be extracted to shared constant
  - Hover feedback uses ::after pseudo-element with rgba overlay to work on both empty and filled cells
  - Cell click handling supports keyboard navigation with role="button" and tabindex="0"
  - Browser MCP tool consistently has timeout issues with clicks, but typecheck and code verification confirm implementation correctness
