- Defined and documented a single package-level coverage command contract for gsnake-web, gsnake-editor, gsnake-core, and gsnake-levels
- Added `coverage` npm scripts for JS packages and reusable `scripts/coverage.sh` scripts for Rust packages
- Updated root and submodule CI coverage jobs to call package-level commands instead of inline coverage invocations
- Standardized and documented coverage output locations: `coverage/` for JS packages and `target/llvm-cov/lcov.info` for Rust packages
- Verified all four coverage commands run successfully locally
- Verified typecheck and test commands pass for all four packages

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Package-level coverage commands are now the source of truth for CI and local runs; update these first when changing coverage behavior
  - For Rust packages, keep coverage flags in `scripts/coverage.sh` to avoid drift between different workflow files
  - Keep coverage outputs package-local (`coverage/` or `target/llvm-cov/lcov.info`) so artifact uploads stay stable across root and standalone workflows
