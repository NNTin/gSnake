## 2026-01-29 - US-001
- Implemented unit tests for resolve_playback_path function in gsnake-levels
- Added 8 comprehensive tests covering all edge cases:
  - Valid level paths (easy, medium, hard)
  - Override path functionality
  - Missing levels directory (error case)
  - No levels component in path (error case)
  - Absolute path handling
  - Nested levels directory
- Files changed: gsnake-levels/src/verify.rs
- Quality checks: cargo test passed (8 tests), cargo check passed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gsnake-levels is a binary-only crate (no lib.rs), so tests must be added as #[cfg(test)] modules in source files
  - The .cargo/config.toml is auto-generated by build.rs and gitignored - must be created manually for first build
  - build.rs detects root repo context by checking ../.git and ../gsnake-core/Cargo.toml
  - When in root repo, build.rs patches git dependency to use local path: ../gsnake-core/engine/core
  - All tests verify behavior without needing actual fixture files - they test path transformation logic
  - gsnake-levels is a git submodule, so changes must be committed within the submodule directory first

## 2026-01-29 - US-002
- Implemented unit tests for load_playback_directions function in gsnake-levels
- Added 9 comprehensive tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Valid playback file with different key formats (Right, R, east, etc.)
  - Real fixture test using playbacks/easy/level_001.json (read-only)
  - Error cases: missing file, invalid JSON, wrong schema
  - Empty array validation
  - Invalid key handling
- Files changed: gsnake-levels/src/playback.rs, gsnake-levels/Cargo.toml (added tempfile dev-dependency)
- Quality checks: cargo test passed (17 total tests), cargo check passed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Used tempfile crate for creating temporary test fixtures without file system pollution
  - Tests verify multiple key formats: short (R/D/L/U), long (Right/Down/Left/Up), cardinal (east/south/west/north)
  - Real fixture test conditionally runs only if fixture exists (graceful handling)
  - Error messages are validated to ensure proper context propagation through anyhow
  - tempfile 3.13 is compatible with the project's Rust edition 2021
  - All tests are self-contained and don't mutate the actual playbacks/ directory
---
## 2026-01-29 - US-003
- Implemented integration tests for verify_level function in gsnake-levels
- Created lib.rs to expose verify and playback modules for integration testing
- Added 3 integration tests in tests/integration_test.rs:
  - test_verify_level_easy_001_succeeds: Verifies levels/easy/level_001.json + playbacks/easy/level_001.json succeeds
  - test_verify_level_does_not_mutate_files: Ensures files in levels/ and playbacks/ are not mutated
  - test_verify_level_with_multiple_levels: Tests multiple level+playback pairs (level_001, level_002, level_003)
- Files changed: gsnake-levels/src/lib.rs (new), gsnake-levels/tests/integration_test.rs (new)
- Quality checks: cargo test passed (20 total tests: 17 unit + 3 integration), cargo check passed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Created lib.rs to expose modules for integration testing (binary-only crates don't expose modules by default)
  - Integration tests run conditionally only if fixture files exist (graceful handling for different environments)
  - Tests verify file immutability by comparing file contents before and after verify_level call
  - Tests use read-only operations on actual fixture files without mutating them
  - Integration tests are automatically discovered in tests/ directory and run separately from unit tests
  - cargo test now runs 3 test suites: lib unit tests, main unit tests, and integration tests
---
## 2026-01-29 - US-004
- Verified that gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/ci.yml already contains a test job
- All acceptance criteria met:
  - ✅ Test job already exists at lines 65-117 in ci.yml
  - ✅ Test job runs cargo test --verbose which includes all unit and integration tests
  - ✅ Workflow configured with proper caching and git authentication for standalone CI
  - ✅ Typecheck passes (verified with cargo check)
- Files reviewed: gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/ci.yml
- No changes needed - CI workflow already complete
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-004 was already completed in previous work - the test job was already in place
  - The CI workflow has two jobs: build and test, running in parallel
  - Both jobs use git-fetch-with-cli and configure git for HTTPS to avoid SSH auth issues
  - The test job uses cargo test --verbose which automatically runs all unit tests (in src/) and integration tests (in tests/)
  - Cargo automatically discovers and runs tests in both locations without additional configuration
