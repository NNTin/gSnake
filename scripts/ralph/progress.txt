# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- gSnake is a monorepo with submodules: gsnake-levels (Rust), gsnake-web (Svelte/TypeScript), gsnake-specs (Markdown), gsnake-editor (Svelte/TypeScript)
- Each submodule has its own build system and tooling
- Git submodules must be committed separately before the main repo
- Always include scripts/test/result.txt in commits per Ralph instructions
