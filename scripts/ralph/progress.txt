# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-30
Branch: ralph/fix-ci-pipeline-errors

## Codebase Patterns
- CI results stored in scripts/test/result.txt (scripts/test/test_act.sh automatically run each iteration)
- Individual job logs in scripts/test/tmp_act_results/ with .log and .status files
- Test with act: act -W <workflow-path> -j <job-name> --container-architecture linux/amd64
- Submodules: gsnake-web, gsnake-editor, gsnake-levels, gsnake-specs
- Workflows use FORCE_GIT_DEPS=true for standalone mode testing
- Full test suite runs with scripts/test/test_act.sh (30+ minutes)
- the full test suite runs using pushed code on remote, so unpushed code are not reflected in the run. git push after committing.
