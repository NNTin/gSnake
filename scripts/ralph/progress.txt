## Codebase Patterns
- In `gsnake-editor`, tool-selection handlers should stay side-effect free for grid data; any state mutation that changes placed entities should go through the command/undo pipeline.
- In `EditorLayout.handleLoad`, hidden file inputs must use idempotent cleanup and hook both `change` and picker-close signals (`cancel` plus `window` focus fallback) so canceled dialogs do not leak DOM nodes.
- In `EditorLayout`, both export and test payloads should be built via `buildLevelExportPayload(...)` to keep `difficulty`, `snakeDirection`, and `totalFood` serialization rules aligned.
- In `EditorLayout` import paths, validate all entity coordinates against current grid bounds before mutating editor state so unsupported coordinates fail loudly instead of partially loading.

## [2026-02-19 17:00:35 CET] - US-001
- Implemented US-001 by removing implicit snake auto-clear on snake-tool selection in `EditorLayout`, so selecting Snake no longer destroys existing snake segments outside undo/redo commands.
- Added regression coverage that places snake segments, switches to Food, reselects Snake, and asserts snake segments remain intact.
- Files changed: `gsnake-editor/src/lib/EditorLayout.svelte`, `gsnake-editor/src/tests/EditorLayout.gridInteractions.test.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `EntityPalette` emits `select` events; `EditorLayout.handleEntitySelect` should only update `selectedEntity` and avoid hidden grid mutations.
  - `EditorLayout.gridInteractions` tests are the right place for undo/tool-selection regressions affecting in-canvas behavior.

## [2026-02-19 17:46:15 CET] - US-002
- Implemented hidden file-input cleanup hardening in `EditorLayout.handleLoad` by introducing a single idempotent cleanup function wired to `change`, `cancel`, and a window-focus fallback for cancel flows.
- Added regression coverage that simulates canceling the load picker and verifies the temporary hidden file input is removed from the DOM.
- Refreshed CI artifact status via `act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml -j gsnake-editor-test --container-architecture linux/amd64` and updated `scripts/test/result.txt` with success output.
- Files changed: `gsnake-editor/src/lib/EditorLayout.svelte`, `gsnake-editor/src/tests/EditorLayout.saveLoad.test.ts`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`, `scripts/test/result.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Load-picker flows should not rely solely on `onchange`; canceled dialogs can skip `change` and leak temporary DOM nodes.
  - Cleanup helpers for transient DOM nodes should be idempotent (`parentNode` guard) because multiple completion paths can fire in browser and test environments.
  - `EditorLayout.saveLoad` tests are the right location for regressions around file-load lifecycle and hidden input teardown.

## [2026-02-19 18:33:12 CET] - US-003
- Replaced `EditorLayout.handleTest`’s ad-hoc payload assembly with `buildLevelExportPayload(...)` using test metadata (`id`, `name`, and default `difficulty`) so test uploads use the same canonical serializer as exports.
- Added a regression test that clicks `Test`, captures the POST body for `/api/test-level`, and asserts canonical payload fields including `difficulty`, runtime snake-direction conversion, and `totalFood`.
- Ran `npm run check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test` in `gsnake-editor`, then refreshed CI status via `act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml -j gsnake-editor-test --container-architecture linux/amd64`.
- Attempted live `agent-browser` verification on `http://localhost:3003`, but repeated command hangs while interacting with editor controls prevented reliable end-to-end browser confirmation; manual browser verification is still recommended.
- Files changed: `gsnake-editor/src/lib/EditorLayout.svelte`, `gsnake-editor/src/tests/EditorLayout.saveLoad.test.ts`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`, `scripts/test/result.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `EditorLayout.handleTest` should treat payload construction as shared model logic; keep endpoint-specific behavior limited to transport (`fetch`) and launch UX.
  - For editor-side API payload regressions, `EditorLayout.saveLoad.test.ts` can validate real request bodies by mocking `fetch` and asserting serialized JSON directly.
  - Refreshing CI with targeted `act -W ... -j ...` runs is sufficient for story-level validation while keeping iteration time low.

## [2026-02-19 19:22:53 CET] - US-004
- Implemented strict in-bounds coordinate validation for editor imports in `EditorLayout` and fail-fast error messaging so negative/out-of-range positions are rejected instead of silently dropped.
- Added regression coverage that loads a level containing `food[0]` at `(-1, 2)` and verifies the editor rejects it with user-facing feedback while leaving the grid unchanged.
- Ran `npm run check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test` in `gsnake-editor`, then refreshed CI status via `act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml -j gsnake-editor-test --container-architecture linux/amd64`.
- Attempted live `agent-browser` verification on `http://localhost:3003`; hidden file-input automation was flaky in headless mode for this flow, so manual browser verification is still recommended.
- Files changed: `gsnake-editor/src/lib/EditorLayout.svelte`, `gsnake-editor/src/tests/EditorLayout.saveLoad.test.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`, `scripts/test/result.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `placeEntitiesFromLevelData(...)` should validate all incoming coordinates before clearing/rebuilding grid state, preventing partial imports on malformed payloads.
  - Regression tests for import validation belong in `EditorLayout.saveLoad.test.ts` and should assert both toast feedback and unchanged editor state.
  - For hidden file pickers in browser automation, direct `upload` may hang; fallback strategies are needed, and manual validation may still be required for picker-driven flows.
