=== Act CI Test Results ===
Started: Sun Feb 15 23:06:10 CET 2026

## Summary

- [SUCCESS] ./.github/workflows/ci.yml::test
- [FAILED] ./gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/ci.yml::test

**Total: 1 passed, 1 failed**

## Failure Notes

- `./gsnake-levels/.github/workflows/ci.yml::test` failed in local `act` because `act` checks out remote sources; the container used a pre-change `gsnake-core` API where `GameEngine::new` is still infallible, so updated `gsnake-levels` code calling `.with_context(...)` on constructor result could not compile.
- This mismatch is expected before pushing both repo and submodule updates.
