## Summary

- [SUCCESS] ./.github/workflows/dependency-audit.yml::npm-audit
- [SUCCESS] ./.github/workflows/dependency-audit.yml::cargo-audit

**Total: 2 passed, 0 failed**

## Notes

- `npm-audit` currently reports moderate/low issues in `gsnake-web`, `gsnake-specs`, and `gsnake-editor`; job remains green because threshold is `--audit-level=high`.
- `cargo-audit` reports allowed warnings (unmaintained/unsound advisories) in `gsnake-core` dependencies and no blocking vulnerabilities.
- `cargo-audit` workflow now generates `gsnake-core/Cargo.lock` during CI because that lockfile is git-ignored in this repository.
